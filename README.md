# MechCar_Statistical_Analysis
R

## Project Overview
The client, AutosRUs, has asked for a statistical analysis of the production data of their prototype, MechaCar, to assist their manufacturing team in producing completed prototypes. Using R script, I performed statistical analysis on two csv files provided by the client, a suspension coil data set and a MechaCar data set.  

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using the MechaCar data set provided by the client, I performed a linear regression analysis. The csv file included data on six different vehicle features: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, all wheeel drive, and miles per gallon (MPG). 

The following imnage shows the results of the statistical analysis performed using MPG as the dependent variable and the remaining features as the independent variable:

#### Summary of Linear Regression Model

3. The linear model is moderately successful at predicting mpg of MechaCar prototypes as the r value is .715. Models with an r value greater than .5 are considered to be effective for predicting.
